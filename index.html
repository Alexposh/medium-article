      <p>Back in 2013, Sébastien, my brother Romain and I decided to launch a coding school to teach creative and entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their own tech products through intensive 9-week bootcamp. At that time, none of us had real design or branding skills. My brother was a lawyer. Sébastien and I were both engineers (French engineers, aka the worst kind in terms of design background 😬).</p>
      <p>We only knew one thing: we wanted to build a program to teach people the technical skills and tools to bring their ideas to life. This program would go far beyond “becoming a full-stack developer” or “learning UX/UI Design, HTML, CSS, ruby and Javascript”. For us, these skills were also a prerequisite for anyone who wanted to develop tech projects autonomously in their current job, start a freelancing career or launch their own startup. And we felt that traditional degrees’ courses were failing to provide students with these new tech skills. As we say in French…</p>
      <h3>🇫🇷 L’éducation supérieure a “un wagon de retard”…</h3>
      <p>An idiom that could be literally translated into: “Higher education has missed the train”. This was the first time we thought of the word “wagon” for our brand name. After giving it some more thought, it seemed like a cool name for different reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It points to this idea of a “missing block” or “missing wagon” in the “train of higher education”.</li>
        <li>A wagon is a vehicle that takes a group of people (like a class of students) on a journey to a destination. This is exactly what our coding bootcamp is about!</li>
        <li>  We didn’t want a brand name using words like “hack”, “code”, “tech”, “app”, etc… For us, code is a means to develop products and reach your goals, not an end in itself.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>So, Le Wagon it was! Vive Le Wagon!</p>

    <h3>Shipping our first logos 🙈</h3>
    <p>After a few drawings on a sheet of paper with a designer friend Julien, we quickly realized that a wagon is a poor design object 😬:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It has no beginning. No end. No movement to it.</li>
      <li>  It makes you think about underground, work, mine, gold rush, etc… not exactly the images we had in mind for our brand!</li>
      </ul>
    <img src="images/handdraw.webp" alt="" id="handdrawn">
    <p>Our first drawings of a “wagon”</p>

    <p>So, at this point, we just thought:</p>
    <h3>Why should it be a real wagon?</h3>

    <p>Why not find ideas from other sources of inspiration and just invent our own “wagon”? After all, no one complains to Github that their Octocat isn’t a real animal (should we tell them?). We decided to explore other directions for our logo: campers and vans. For us, they encapsulated our values and the bootcamp’s ethos way more than a ‘traditional’ wagon:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A camper is about adventure. It’s about the journey, like the tech journey our students experience with us.</li>
      <li>A camper is about community, like the community of talented and passionate alumni we are building.</li>
      <li>A camper is about freedom, the freedom we want to give our students with their new tech skills.</li>
      <li>Well, also, our CTO Seb is a surfer 🏄‍ which makes the camper a cool symbol for him personally!</li>
    </ul>

<div class="second-half">
<p>So we searched for “van” examples on The Noun Project and spent an afternoon with Julien designing our own genuine version. We added a random handwriting font (that looks really bad retrospectively 🙈).</p>

<p>Our first logo was born.</p>
<img src="" alt="">
<p>Designing our first logo from The Noun Project (2013)</p>

<p>We quickly reworked on this logo for different reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The font was really terrible 😱</li>
  <li>We needed a square version for social media and to separate the van from the text to be able to use both separately.</li>
</ul>

<p>This gave birth to the second version of the logo, built with Thomas, one of our first front-end developers, who is now a freelance product designer.</p>


<p>Second iteration: better font + separating the icon from the text.</p>
<p>Enough iteration! It was time to teach, improve our curriculum, take care of our students, and make Le Wagon grow!</p>

<h3>Bootstrapping our brand</h3>
<p>So, in 2013, we started growing our company without any proper brand system: just a logo and a name. As real “bootstrappers”, our approach was very pragmatic, though naive and lacking vision. We were just coming out with a new brand system on the fly for every new increment of our website.</p>
